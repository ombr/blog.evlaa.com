Improve your website is primordial since it will help you to get more customers, to be more professional and put your futur clients in confidence. 

As an entrepreneur in the web industry, here are my 5 biggest tips to improve your professional photography website. 

#1. Mobility 

![Why do you need a responsive photography website?](/assets/article_images/2016-07-20-5-tips-to-improve-your-photography-website/web-statistic.png)

As you could see, the smartphones and tablets are everywhere. **The internet traffic on mobile devices is more than 50%** and it’s only the beginning. 
There is a big chance that your customers will see your website on their smartphone or tablet. 
As this is your personnal branding, it’s very important to have your website optimized for mobile devices. 

>Would you like to visit a website where you can’t read all the text, where the images are cut in the middle? I’m sure, you don’t :-)

Besides Google has recently announced that they will promote the websites that are optimized for mobile devices in their algorithm…

- **Use responsive templates** (in case your website is with Wordpress or any other CMS for exemple)
- **Use tools** : if you are not an expert. All the current platforms to develop a website have responsive templates since it is one of the biggest revolution on the web industry for the past 10 years.
- **Don’t use heavy element** that will take a lot of time to load. Mobile devices have always good internet connection and memory.
- In case you are customized the CSS, don’t use fixed margin, size or element and use a percentage size instead.


#2. Rapidity 

![Your clients have no time and Google algorithm as well](/assets/article_images/2016-07-20-5-tips-to-improve-your-photography-website/clock.jpg)

With internet the quantity of information we have has expanded a lot. We have so much stuff to read, to watch, to do. A lot of people are busy and don’t have enough time to do whatever they want. 

>Time is the only ressource we can’t expand, so it’s precious. For you and for your Clients as well. 

You need to have a site that is very fast to load. A lot of user will close a website if it’s too long to load and will never come back again. What a shame to loose a visistor before they have any chance to see your work. 

What would you say in a restaurant if you need to wait 1 hour before being seated and 1 hour to get your meal…

Besides the search engines take this in consideration in their algorithms, it's even more important :-).

- **Use small resolution images** - you don’t need the high resolution, the visitors will not print them and remember that a lot of visitors will be on mobile devices.
- **Do not have a lot of images on the same page**. The browser will need to load all of them and will be over charged. Either do small galleries or use pagination.
- **use tool** to build your website if you are not an expert. Their work is to improve their tool and the speed is usually one of the biggest priority.


#3. Easy to use

![Your client are not always technology aware...](/assets/article_images/2016-07-20-5-tips-to-improve-your-photography-website/easy.jpg)

Your clients are not always very confident with the new technologies and with internet. Not everybody know how to navigate and how to deal with internet. 
Making you site very easy to use with very simple navigation, menu, pages… will allow everybody to watch your work and navigate to your website easily. 

You don’t need to have every details on your website. Make the things simple and you will see that people will love to go to your website and find the informations they want. 

>What about the paperwork where you are never able to find the information except by taking too much time to read 1000 pages of text. Do you like it?

- **Easy navigation** : Do not use strange navigation between your images. 
- **Use popular conventions** (a vertical scroll is a vertical scroll not a slideshow)
- **Clear menu**
- One thing per page or per section. Do not multiply information, it will confuse your readers

#4. SEO

**Your website is one of the most scallable way to get new clients**. It is your online visibility. But it’s very hard to be found by your clients since there are tons of photography websites. You need to optimize your website for the search engines (as google), for exemple by choosing the right keywords. 

If you choose “portrait photographer” as keyword, you will be in competition with tons of other portrait photographer. You should use something like “original corporate portrait photographer for startup”. That’s call long tail keywords and it’s more specific to your business and less competitive.

- **Find the keywords your client could use** to find you and use them on your website.
You don’t need to use them in the same order… The search engines are smart, trust me ;-) 
- Define correctly title, header, images titles, images alt text (with keywords and it’s need to be relevant regarding the content you have on the page)
- Fill the meta datas 
- Simplify the **social sharing/following**
- **Be present** : Social media, blog, comments, like...

#5. Easy to maintain

**You are a photographer not a web developper**. You have already a lot of things to do on the Photography side. You need to save your time to focus on the things where you are the best. 

> It’s better to use tools/platforms that allows you to get a website easily and quickly.

- Don’t try DIY website if you don’t want to take time to work on it. 
- Use easy tools and don’t customize it too much if you are not ready to go into it
- make it simple with a simple folders and files naming…
- If you have enough budget, you can pay a freelance to build your website. But you need to insist about the maintenance to be able to change a little bit the content if needed.
