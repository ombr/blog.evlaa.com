As a photographer, you need a great website to show your work and to get new clients. As I told you on my previous article, have an optimized website is very important otherwise it will be a bit useless since nobody will see it.

The website is something that could take so much time since you have a lot of possibilities and you can always do it better. Using platform is a good way to have professional, modern and well maintained website without taking so much time to build it. 

Except if you love it, if you really want to have custom design, have time, experience or money, you should use a platform.
